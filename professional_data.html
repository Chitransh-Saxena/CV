    <ul>
        To solidify my understanding of <b>Low Level Design</b>, I did some standard stuff

        <li>I am trying to build a <b>Spring Boot Application</b> which is basically for Stress Management, but it is still a work in progress. ---> <a href = "https://github.com/Chitransh-Saxena/MonkApp">Here is the github link to it</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>A good amount of time of my professional career has gone in writing enterprise level C++ code. Here is my attempt on understanding this language a little better</p>
    <li>I did not follow the conventional approach of writing projects</li>
    <li>So, simply a theoretical understanding with basic codes</li>
            <ul><a href = "https://github.com/Chitransh-Saxena/DSA/tree/OOPS/Object%20Oriented%20Programming">OOPS with C++</a></ul>
            <ul><a href = "https://github.com/Chitransh-Saxena/DSA/tree/OOPS/Multithreading">Multithreading in C++, trust me it is far more complicated than Java</a><ul>It is not complete yet btw</ul></ul>
